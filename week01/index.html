            <ol>
                <li><span>Doing Stuff with Web Things:</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>Think. Decide what products/technology you need.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Design. Plan, plan, plan</span></li>
                        <li><span>Test. This isn't exactly running tests. This is planning the tests you will need to run to make sure it is functioning properly. Sort of like a science experiment. Designing the procedure/test so you know you can get the data and see the results.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Create. Start the actual work. Run into problems? Return to step 1 and repeat.</span></li>
                        <li><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#HTML_color_names" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Web Colors</a></span></li>
                        <li><span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">localStorage documentation</a></span></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><span>Master Mobile UX:</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>Mobile first; of course.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Shifting access buttons to the bottom where fingers can reach.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Hamburger button is not as well known yet, meanwhile the word menu within something that makes it look like a button still receives the most clicks/attention from users.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Floating labels within the content of an input. I.e. remove labels, and then when the user clicks in a field the hint text also displays as a label at the top (but inside) the input.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Make larger check boxes...</span></li>
                        <li><span>Don't mask the password field. Instead add the button to hide/show it as needed. Again default is visible.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Anchor tag phone numbers... href="tel:12223334444". This hint is likely mostly for mobile devices.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Idea: use paralax design to place an add behind the regular content. Grants a small window for the add to be peeped at...</span></li>

                <li><span>Doing Stuff with Web Things:</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>What section am I supposed to be reading? The instructions don't appear to match the reading.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Where does it store the localstorage key value pairs?</span></li>
                        <li><span>How do you retrieve them? localStorage.getItem(value)</span></li>                   </span>     
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><span>Master Mobile UX:</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>Moving menus to the bottom brings them closer to the fingers/thumb in particular, but doesn't that also make it easier to accidentally click them lowering the user experience?</span></li>
                        <li><span>Follow-up: Are there statistics to show what the trade-off is? Or some other guidelines to adjust this format so that it works better?</span></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
