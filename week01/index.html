            <h4>Notes:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Doing Stuff with Web Things:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Think. Decide what products/technology you need.</li>
                        <li>Design. Plan, plan, plan</li>
                        <li>Test. This isn't exactly running tests. This is planning the tests you will need to run to make sure it is functioning properly. Sort of like a science experiment. Designing the procedure/test so you know you can get the data and see the results.</li>
                        <li>Create. Start the actual work. Run into problems? Return to step 1 and repeat.</li>

                        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">localStorage documentation</a></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Master Mobile UX:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mobile first; of course.</li>
                        <li>Shifting access buttons to the bottom where fingers can reach.</li>
                        <li>Hamburger button is not as well known yet, meanwhile the word menu within something that makes it look like a button still receives the most clicks/attention from users.</li>
                        <li>Floating labels within the content of an input. I.e. remove labels, and then when the user clicks in a field the hint text also displays as a label at the top (but inside) the input.</li>
                        <li>Make larger check boxes...</li>
                        <li>Don't mask the password field. Instead add the button to hide/show it as needed. Again default is visible.</li>
                        <li>Anchor tag phone numbers... href="tel:12223334444". This hint is likely mostly for mobile devices.</li>
                        <li>Idea: use paralax design to place an add behind the regular content. Grants a small window for the add to be peeped at...</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

            <h4>Questions:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Doing Stuff with Web Things:
                    <ol>
                        <li>What section am I supposed to be reading? The instructions don't appear to match the reading.</li>
                        <li>Where does it store the localstorage key value pairs?</li>
                        <li>How do you retrieve them? localStorage.getItem(value)</li>                        
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Master Mobile UX:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Moving menus to the bottom brings them closer to the fingers/thumb in particular, but doesn't that also make it easier to accidentally click them lowering the user experience?</li>
                        <li>Follow-up: Are there statistics to show what the trade-off is? Or some other guidelines to adjust this format so that it works better?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
